# ahk_maker
An AHK to make macros, so you can call them at any time

The idea is for basic repetitive clicks and keyboard strokes, to start the program, let it know whether you would like to create a new one or run an old one.

The main purpose would be that you are doing a repetitive task and wish you could just write an auto hot key macro loop real quick, and you run the program and loop through your macro once, and then it will run until you tell it to stop.
And it will "store" the name of all of them you create so you can use them again, instead of having a billion keystrokes for a billion things.
